***Advanced Telepathy***. The flumph perceives the content of any telepathic communication within 60 feet of it.

***Prone Deficiency***. If the flumph receives the Prone condition, roll a die. On an odd number, it has the Incapacitated condition. At the end of each of its turns, the flumph makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, ending the Incapacitated condition on a success.

***Telepathic Shroud***. The flumph’s thoughts can’t be read by any means, and magic can’t detect its location or observe it remotely.

### Actions

***Tentacle. Melee Attack Roll***: +4, reach 5 feet. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) Acid damage.

***Stench Spray (1/Proficiency Level).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw*: one creature the flumph can see within 15 feet. Failure: The target is coated in a foul-smelling liquid, exudes a stench for 1d4 hours, and has the Poisoned condition while the stench lasts. Other creatures have the Poisoned condition while in a 5-foot Emanation originating from the coated target. The target can remove the stench on itself if it bathes during a Short or Long Rest.

Some flumph abilities resemble magical effects. These are **innate psionic manifestations**, not spellcasting.

* The flumph does not gain spell slots.
* No verbal, somatic, or material components are required.
* Saving throw DCs for flumph abilities are calculated as follows:
  **8 + the flumph’s proficiency bonus + its Wisdom modifier**

### Action Economy and Control

* The flumph acts on its own initiative.
* It can use actions, bonus actions, and reactions as described in its stat block and learned abilities.
* Any ability that requires coordination with its master explicitly states so.

## Flumph Advancement Options

As its master advances, the flumph gains new actions, traits, and feats in accordance with the companion advancement table.

### New Traits

Traits emphasize protection, empathy, and psychic disruption.

#### Companion Bond

The flumph instinctively protects its master. If the master is incapacitated, the flumph prioritizes warning allies, interposing itself, and disrupting hostile creatures.

#### Aberrant Insight

The flumph gains expertise in **Insight**.
It has advantage on Insight checks made to detect hostile intent, emotional manipulation, or deceit.

#### Mind Anchor

While the flumph is within 10 feet of its master, neither the flumph nor its master can be charmed or frightened.

#### Psychic Dampener

Creatures of the flumph’s choice within 10 feet have disadvantage on the first attack roll they make each turn.

#### Ninefold Calm

When the flumph is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.
Once this trait is used, it cannot be used again until the flumph finishes a long rest.

\page

### Flumph Feats

Feats represent heightened psionic control and empathic defense.

#### Empathic Shield

When an ally within 30 feet takes damage, the flumph can use its reaction to reduce the damage by **1d8 + the flumph’s proficiency bonus**.
Uses equal to the flumph’s proficiency bonus per long rest.

#### Thought Static

Creatures poisoned by the flumph’s **Stench Spray** have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until the end of their next turn.

### Psychic Veil

Once per long rest, the flumph and its master become invisible to creatures relying on telepathy, empathy, or psychic senses for 1 minute.

#### Hover Guard

While the flumph is adjacent to its master, the master has advantage on saving throws against charm and fear effects.

#### Psionic Recoil

When the flumph succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, the creature that forced the saving throw takes psychic damage equal to the flumph’s proficiency bonus.

#### Resonant Backlash
*Prerequisite: Psychic Rebound reaction*

The flumph’s defensive psionics ripple outward when it is threatened. When the flumph uses Psychic Rebound, it can choose to amplify the effect. If it does so:

* The psychic damage dealt by Psychic Rebound increases by an amount equal to the flumph’s Wisdom modifier.
* Until the start of the flumph’s next turn, the attacker has disadvantage on saving throws against effects created by the flumph or its master.

Once the flumph uses Resonant Backlash, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.
