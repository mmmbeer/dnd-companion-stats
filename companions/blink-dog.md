### New Traits  

Traits are passive or always-on abilities that modify how the blink dog perceives, survives, or interacts with the world.

#### Fey Touched
All of the blink dog's attacks are treated as magical. The blink dog has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic cannot put it to sleep.

#### Phase Echo.
The blink dog senses teleportation and invisibility within 90 feet.

When it uses Blink Step, the first attack against it before the start of its next turn is made with disadvantage.

#### Phase Skirmisher

When the blink dog uses **Blink Step**, it can make one melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of its destination.

#### Pack Harrier

The blink dog gains **Pack Tactics**: The blink dog has Advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the blink dog's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition.

In addition, when the blink dog hits a creature that is within 5 feet of one of its allies, that creature has disadvantage on the next opportunity attack it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### Planar Tracker

The blink dog gains proficiency in **Survival**.

* It has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track creatures on the same plane of existence.
* It always knows its own planar location.
\column
::
#### Interplanar Tracker

*Prerequisite: Planar Tracker*

The blink dog gains expertise in **Survival**.

* It has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track creatures across planar boundaries.
* Once per long rest, it can determine the plane of existence and approximate location of a creature it has seen within the last month

#### Fey Resilience
When the blink dog is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and immediately shifts to the Feywild (or another plane it has previously visited). The blink dog returns to the nearest unoccupied space next to its master at the end of a long rest.

### New Actions

Any of the following actions may be learned as a **New Action** advancement.

#### Phase Pounce

***Phase Pounce.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d10 + 3 slashing damage.

If the blink dog teleported this turn or moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. On a failure, the blink dog can make a **Bite** attack as a bonus action.

#### Flurry of Claws

***Flurry of Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 2d6 + 3 slashing damage. This attack ignores resistance to nonmagical slashing damage.

#### Blink Ram

***Blink Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d8 + 3 bludgeoning damage.

Immediately before making this attack, the blink dog can teleport up to 30 feet in a straight line toward the target. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet and knocked prone.

#### Displacement Rake

***Displacement Rake.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d6 + 3 slashing damage plus 1d6 force damage. Until the start of the blink dog’s next turn, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against the blink dog or its master.

\column
:::::
#### Fey Phase Guard (Reaction)
When the blink dog is targeted by an attack it can see, it can use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. This reaction can be used a number of times equal to the blink dog’s proficiency bonus per long rest.


#### Blink Grip

***Blink Grip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 5 ft., one creature **Large or smaller**.
On a hit, the target is grappled (escape DC = 8 + the blink dog’s proficiency bonus + its Dexterity modifier).

This grapple is magical. While the target is grappled by the blink dog:

* The target must remain within 5 feet of the blink dog.
* The blink dog can move the grappled creature as part of its movement while maintaining the grapple.
* If the blink dog teleports, the grapple immediately ends unless the teleportation distance is **10 feet or less**, in which case the blink dog may bring the grappled creature with it.

While the grapple persists, the blink dog can use a bonus action to make a **Bite** attack against the grappled creature, provided the creature remains within 5 feet of the blink dog.

The grapple ends if the target escapes, the blink dog releases the creature (no action required), or the blink dog becomes incapacitated.

### Blink Dog Feats

#### Flickering Hover

The blink dog can hover a few inches above the ground. While hovering:

* Its normal movement speed (or movement-based actions) are unaffected.
* It ignores nonmagical difficult terrain.
* It does not trigger pressure plates or tripwires.
* It leaves no tracks unless it chooses to.
* It can travel half its movement speed as if flying (not hovering).

#### Fey Distraction

As a bonus action, the blink dog creates illusory sights and sounds around itself or an ally within 10 feet. Each creature of the blink dog’s choice within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### Blink Anchor

When a creature within 30 feet uses teleportation or extradimensional movement, the blink dog can use its **reaction** to mark the creature for up to 1 minute.
While marked, the blink dog always knows the creature’s location and can teleport adjacent to it once before the mark ends. The mark ends early if the blink dog marks another creature or the creature dies.

#### Blinkcasting

The blink dog gains innate fey magic. It learns one spell from the list below each time its proficiency bonus increases. These spells are innate abilities, not spellcasting.  Their DC is calculated as *8 + the blink dog’s proficiency bonus + the blink dog’s Dexterity modifier*.

**Spell List:** *Faerie Fire, Fog Cloud, Color Spray, Alter Self, Invisibility, Enlarge/Reduce (self only), Enthrall, Blur, Sleep, Longstrider*

Each spell can be cast once per long rest unless otherwise specified.
\column
#### Blink Grip Feat: **Phase Lock**
*Prerequisites: Blink Grip trait, companion level 12*

The blink dog has learned to momentarily anchor its prey within overlapping strands of fey space. When the blink dog successfully grapples a creature using **Blink Grip**, it can choose to phase-lock the target until the start of the blink dog’s next turn.

While phase-locked:

* The grappled creature cannot benefit from teleportation or extradimensional movement.
* The blink dog can teleport up to **20 feet**, bringing the grappled creature with it.
* The grapple still ends if the blink dog becomes incapacitated or if the creature escapes normally.

Once the blink dog uses Phase Lock, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.
