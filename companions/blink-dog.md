This attack does not provoke opportunity attacks.
If the attack hits, the target cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.


### Pack Harrier
The blink dog gains **Pack Tactics**.
In addition, when the blink dog hits a creature that is within 5 feet of one of its allies, that creature has disadvantage on the next opportunity attack it makes before the end of its next turn.


### Fey Phase Guard

When the blink dog is targeted by an attack it can see, it can use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
This reaction can be used a number of times equal to the blink dog’s proficiency bonus per long rest.


### Planar Tracker
