## Tressym Advancement Options

As its master advances, the tressym gains new actions, traits, and feats in accordance with the companion advancement table.

\page

### New Traits

Traits emphasize vigilance, illusion control, and arcane interference.

#### Spell Sense

The tressym gains a special sense out to 30 feet that detects active spell effects, magical auras, and creatures concentrating on spells.
This sense reveals direction and general intensity but not spell details. It is blocked by total cover and suppressed in antimagic fields.

#### Illusion Sense

The tressym automatically recognizes visual illusions when it sees them, though it must still interact with them normally to reveal them to others.

#### Silent Watcher

The tressym does not trigger magical alarms, glyphs, or wards while flying, unless it chooses to.

#### Arcane Alert

As a bonus action, the tressym warns one creature it can see within 30 feet. That creature has advantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell before the end of its next turn.

#### Nine Lives

When the tressym is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.
Once this trait is used, it cannot be used again until the tressym finishes a long rest.

#### Arcane Savant

The tressym gains expertise in Perception and proficiency in Arcana. 
In addition, the tressym can use its Perception skill in place of Arcana when making ability checks to notice magical effects, illusions, or ongoing spells.

### New Actions

Any of the following actions may be learned as a **New Action** advancement.

#### Arcane Pounce

***Arcane Pounce.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d8 + 2 slashing damage.
If the tressym flew at least 20 feet straight toward the target this turn, the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

#### Spellrake

***Spellrake.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d4 + 2 slashing damage plus 1d6 force damage.
Until the start of the tressym’s next turn, the target has disadvantage on spell attack rolls.

#### Arcane Disrupting Claws

***Arcane Disrupting Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d6 + 2 slashing damage.
If the target is concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to maintain concentration.

#### Wing Slash

***Wing Slash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d4 + 2 slashing damage.
The target cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

### Tressym Feats

Feats represent heightened vigilance and magical disruption.

#### Spell Sniffer

The range of **Spell Sense** increases to 60 feet.
In addition, the tressym can distinguish illusions from other magical effects at a glance.

#### Illusion Breaker

When the tressym touches an illusion, the illusion is revealed to all creatures within 10 feet until the end of the tressym’s next turn.

#### Arcane Interference

When a creature within 30 feet casts a spell, the tressym can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on one attack roll or saving throw caused by that spell.
Uses equal to the tressym’s proficiency bonus per long rest.

#### Vigilant Perch

While perched on its master, the tressym grants:

* advantage on initiative rolls, and
* advantage on the first saving throw against a spell the master makes each combat.

#### Arcane Tail Lash

When a creature within 5 feet of the tressym casts a spell, the tressym can use its reaction to make a **Claws** attack against that creature.
