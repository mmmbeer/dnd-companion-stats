***Keen Senses.*** The tressym has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.

:
***Spell Sense.*** The tressym can sense the presence of magic within 30 feet. This sense detects active spells, magical effects, and illusions, but not their exact nature or school.

:
***Companion Bond.*** The tressym acts on its master’s initiative. It obeys verbal commands (no action required). If the master is incapacitated, the tressym prioritizes warning allies, evasion, and disrupting hostile spellcasters.

:
***Feline Agility.*** The tressym can move through a hostile creature’s space without provoking opportunity attacks, provided it does not end its movement there.

### Actions

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.

### Arcane Awareness and Special Abilities

Some tressym skills or attacks resemble magical effects.

* These abilities are **innate supernatural traits**, not spellcasting.
* The tressym does not gain spell slots.
* No verbal, somatic, or material components are required.
* Any saving throw DC for tressym abilities is calculated as follows:
  **8 + the tressym’s proficiency bonus + the tressym’s Dexterity modifier**

### Action Economy and Control

* The tressym acts on its own initiative.
* It can use actions, bonus actions, and reactions as described in its stat block and learned abilities.
* Any ability that requires the player character’s reaction or coordination explicitly states so.

## Tressym Companion Feats

### Spell Sniffer

The range of **Spell Sense** increases to 60 feet.
In addition, the tressym can distinguish illusions from other magical effects.

### Illusion Breaker

When the tressym touches an illusion, the illusion is revealed to all creatures within 10 feet until the end of the tressym’s next turn.

### Arcane Interference

When a creature within 30 feet casts a spell, the tressym can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on one attack roll or saving throw caused by that spell.

This reaction can be used a number of times equal to the tressym’s proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Vigilant Perch

While perched on its master, the tressym grants:

* advantage on initiative rolls
* advantage on the first saving throw against a spell the master makes each combat

### Nine Lives

When the tressym is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.

Once this feature is used, it cannot be used again until the tressym finishes a long rest.

### Arcane Tail Lash

When a creature within 5 feet of the tressym casts a spell, the tressym can make a **Claws** attack against that creature as a reaction.

***Arcane Disrupting Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

*Hit:* 1d4 + 3 slashing damage.
The target cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

### Arcane Pounce

***Arcane Pounce.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

***Spellrake.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 1d4 + 3 slashing damage plus 1d6 force damage.

## New Skills

### Silent Watcher

The tressym does not trigger magical alarms, glyphs, or wards while flying, unless it chooses to.

### Arcane Alert

As a bonus action, the tressym warns an ally within 30 feet.
That ally gains advantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell before the end of its next turn.

### Illusion Sense

The tressym automatically knows when it sees an illusion, though it must still act normally to reveal or interact with it.

### Spell Anchor

When a creature within 30 feet teleports or uses magical movement, the tressym can use its reaction to mark that creature for 1 minute.
While marked, the tressym always knows the creature’s location.
The mark ends early if the tressym marks another creature or the creature dies.
