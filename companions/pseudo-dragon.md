## Pseudodragon Feats

### Draconic Watcher

The pseudodragon gains **advantage on initiative rolls**.
In addition, it cannot be surprised while conscious.

### Venom Savant
When a creature fails its saving throw against the pseudodragon’s **Sting**, the poisoned condition lasts **an additional hour**.
If the creature falls unconscious, it has disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist waking early.

### Winged Interference

When a creature within 5 feet of the pseudodragon attacks the pseudodragon’s master, the pseudodragon can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll by distracting the attacker.

### Arcane Eavesdropper

The pseudodragon can sense active spellcasting, magical effects, or spell concentration within 30 feet.

Once per long rest, the pseudodragon can relay a brief sensory snapshot to its master as a reaction.

When reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.
Once used, this feature cannot be used again until a long rest.


### Venom Control

When the pseudodragon hits a creature with **Sting**, it may choose to suppress the unconscious effect and instead impose disadvantage on the creature’s next saving throw before the end of its next turn.
