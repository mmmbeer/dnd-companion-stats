Some pseudodragon abilities resemble magical effects. These are **innate draconic abilities**, not spellcasting.

* The pseudodragon does not gain spell slots.
* No verbal, somatic, or material components are required.
* Saving throw DCs for pseudodragon abilities are calculated as follows:
  **8 + the pseudodragon’s proficiency bonus + its Dexterity modifier**

## Action Economy and Control

* The pseudodragon acts on its own initiative.
* It can use actions, bonus actions, and reactions as described in its stat block and learned abilities.
* Any ability that requires the master’s reaction or coordination explicitly states so.

## Pseudodragon Advancement Options

As its master advances, the pseudodragon gains new actions, traits, and feats in accordance with the companion advancement table.

### New Traits

Traits are passive abilities that emphasize perception, venom mastery, and arcane awareness.

#### Draconic Watcher

The pseudodragon gains advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be surprised while conscious.

#### Arcane Eavesdropper

The pseudodragon gains a special sense out to 30 feet that detects active spellcasting, magical effects, or creatures concentrating on spells.
This sense reveals direction and approximate intensity but not spell details. It is blocked by total cover and suppressed in antimagic fields.

#### Venom Savant

When a creature fails its saving throw against the pseudodragon’s **Sting**, the poisoned condition lasts an additional hour.

#### Venom Control

When the pseudodragon hits a creature with its **Sting**, the target makes its Constitution saving throw with disadvantage.

On a failed saving throw, the creature is unconscious for the duration specified by the Sting. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes additional poison damage equal to half the Sting’s damage (rounded down).

#### Psychic Link

The range of the pseudodragon’s telepathy with its master increases to 1 mile while on the same plane of existence.
Once per long rest, the pseudodragon can use its reaction to transmit a brief sensory snapshot to its master.

#### Draconic Resilience

The pseudodragon gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws.
When reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.
Once this trait is used, it cannot be used again until the pseudodragon finishes a long rest.

#### Wing Buffet

*Hit:* 1d6 + 2 bludgeoning damage.
The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet.

#### Venom Mark

*Hit:* 1d4 + 2 piercing damage.
Until the end of the pseudodragon’s next turn, the pseudodragon and its master have advantage on the first attack roll made against the target.

*Hit:* 1d6 + 2 psychic damage.

### Pseudodragon Feats

Feats represent specialized mastery of flight, venom, and arcane interference.

#### Silent Flight

The pseudodragon’s movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Winged Interference

When a creature within 5 feet of the pseudodragon attacks its master, the pseudodragon can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
This reaction can be used a number of times equal to the pseudodragon’s proficiency bonus per long rest.

#### Arcane Perch

While perched on its master, the pseudodragon grants advantage on one saving throw against a spell once per long rest.

#### Subtle Invisibility

As a bonus action, the pseudodragon becomes invisible until the start of its next turn or until it makes an attack.
Uses equal to the pseudodragon’s proficiency bonus per long rest.

#### Draconic Focus

Once per long rest, when the pseudodragon forces a creature to make a saving throw, it can impose disadvantage on that saving throw.

#### Adaptive Venom
*Prerequisite: Venom Control trait*

The pseudodragon can alter the nature of its venom in response to different prey. When the pseudodragon hits a creature with Sting, it can choose one of the following damage types for the venom instead of poison: acid, lightning, psychic.

The chosen damage type replaces the poison damage and poison condition for that attack. Any additional effects granted by Venom Control apply normally.

Once the pseudodragon changes the damage type of its Sting in this way, it cannot do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.
