Some pseudodragon skills or attacks resemble magical effects.

* These abilities are **innate draconic traits**, not spellcasting.
* The pseudodragon does not gain spell slots.
* No verbal, somatic, or material components are required.
* Any saving throw DC for pseudodragon abilities is calculated as follows:
  **8 + the pseudodragon’s proficiency bonus + the pseudodragon’s Dexterity modifier**

### Action Economy and Control

* The pseudodragon acts on its own initiative.
* It can use actions, bonus actions, and reactions as described in its stat block and learned abilities.
* Any ability that requires the player character’s reaction or coordination explicitly states so.

## Pseudodragon Companion Feats

### Draconic Watcher

The pseudodragon gains advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be surprised while conscious.

### Venom Savant

When a creature fails its saving throw against the pseudodragon’s **Sting**, the poisoned condition lasts an additional hour.
If the creature falls unconscious, it has disadvantage on the saving throw made to awaken early.

### Winged Interference

When a creature within 5 feet of the pseudodragon attacks its master, the pseudodragon can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

Uses equal to the pseudodragon’s proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Arcane Eavesdropper

The pseudodragon can sense active spellcasting, magical effects, or spell concentration within 30 feet.
This sense reveals direction and approximate strength but not spell details.

### Psychic Link

The range of the pseudodragon’s telepathy with its master increases to **1 mile** while on the same plane.
Once per long rest, the pseudodragon can relay a brief sensory snapshot to its master as a reaction.

### Draconic Resilience

The pseudodragon gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws.
When reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it instead drops to 1 hit point and becomes invisible until the end of its next turn.

Once used, this feature cannot be used again until the pseudodragon finishes a long rest.

### Venom Control

When the pseudodragon hits a creature with **Sting**, it may suppress the unconscious effect.
Instead, the target has disadvantage on its next saving throw before the end of its next turn.
